Do you have a calibration gas with a known concentration of CO2?

Air is pretty good - it has 400ppm CO2 if you get fresh air from outdoors. If you have a tank of Nitrogen or Oxygen, you can use that to get a reading for zero CO2.

A quick scan of the datasheet for the MQ135 shows that it responds to a lot of gases. If someone farts nearby, it will detect it and you can't tell which gas it was. Actual CO2 sensors cost $80-$400 for the cheap ones.
